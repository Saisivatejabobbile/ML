📅 Day 7 – Logistic Regression & Model Comparison
Concepts Covered

Regression vs classification

Logistic Regression principles

Sigmoid function behavior

Probability thresholds

Tasks and Execution

Task 1: Problem Transformation

Converted continuous prices into binary classes (e.g., high/low).

Task 2: Logistic Regression Training

Trained classifier on transformed data.

Generated probability outputs.

Task 3: Model Comparison

Linear Regression:

Predicts exact price

Logistic Regression:

Predicts category

Validation

Verified correct model usage per problem type.
