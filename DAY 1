Day 1: Introduction to Machine Learning
•	Understanding what Machine Learning is
•	Why Machine Learning is needed
•	Types of ML: Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement (overview)
•	Basic ML workflow (problem → data → model → prediction)
•	Task 1: Write a simple definition of ML in your own words
•	Task 2: Identify one real-life problem that can be solved using ML
•	Task 3: Define the problem statement, input data, and expected output for that problem


📅 Day 1 – Machine Learning Fundamentals
Concepts Covered

What Machine Learning is:
Learning patterns from historical data to make predictions on new data.

Why Machine Learning is needed:
Rule-based systems fail when:

Relationships are non-linear

Data volume is large

Rules are dynamic or unknown

Types of Machine Learning:

Supervised Learning: Labeled data (used in this project)

Unsupervised Learning: Pattern discovery

Reinforcement Learning: Reward-based learning

Machine Learning Workflow:

Problem Definition
→ Data Collection
→ Data Cleaning
→ Feature Selection
→ Model Training
→ Evaluation
→ Prediction

Tasks and Execution

Task 1: Define ML

Created a concise definition explaining learning from data instead of rules.

Task 2: Identify Real-World Problem

Selected house price prediction based on relevance and applicability.

Task 3: Define Inputs and Output

Inputs: house features

Output: predicted price

Validation

Confirmed the problem fits regression requirements.

Confirmed data availability.
