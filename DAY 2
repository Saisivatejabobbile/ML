📅 Day 2 – Dataset Collection & Understanding
Concepts Covered

Data vs dataset

Features vs target

Structured vs unstructured data

CSV file organization

Tasks and Execution

Task 1: Dataset Collection

Searched publicly available housing datasets.

Selected dataset with numerical pricing information.

Ensured dataset size is sufficient for experimentation.

Task 2: Feature and Target Identification

Mapped each column to:

Input feature

Target variable

Removed irrelevant columns conceptually.

Task 3: Dataset Analysis
Performed initial inspection:

Row count (dataset size)

Column count

Data types

Presence of missing values

Presence of extreme values

Issues Identified

Possible missing values

Features on different numeric scales

Potential outliers
