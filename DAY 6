📅 Day 6 – Train-Test Split & Linear Regression
Concepts Covered

Importance of data splitting

Overfitting vs underfitting

Linear Regression mechanics

Cost minimization

Tasks and Execution

Task 1: Train-Test Split

Split dataset into training and testing sets.

Prevented data leakage.

Task 2: Model Training

Trained Linear Regression model.

Learned how coefficients represent feature influence.

Task 3: Model Evaluation

Used:

Mean Squared Error

R² score

Analyzed prediction accuracy.

Validation

Compared training vs testing performance.

Checked for signs of overfitting.
