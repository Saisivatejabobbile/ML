📅 Day 5 – Data Visualization & Preprocessing
Concepts Covered

Importance of visual analysis

Feature-target relationships

Distribution analysis

Outlier impact

Tasks and Execution

Task 1: Visualization

Plotted scatter graphs for:

Area vs Price

Bedrooms vs Price

Task 2: Pattern Detection

Observed positive correlation between area and price.

Detected data spread and noise.

Task 3: Feature Finalization

Retained features with visible influence on price.

Considered removing weak or redundant features.

Validation

Ensured selected features align with regression assumptions.
