📅 Day 3 – NumPy Essentials for ML
Concepts Covered

NumPy arrays vs Python lists

Vectorization benefits

Memory efficiency

Numerical computation for ML

Tasks and Execution

Task 1: NumPy Data Loading

Extracted numerical columns from dataset.

Converted them into NumPy arrays.

Task 2: Statistical Analysis

Computed:

Mean → central tendency

Min / Max → value range

Used results to understand scale differences.

Task 3: Feature and Target Construction

Created feature matrix X.

Created target vector y.

Verified dimensions using .shape.

Validation

Ensured alignment between feature rows and target values.

Confirmed compatibility with scikit-learn.
